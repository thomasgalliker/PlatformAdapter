# PlatformAdapter
The main goal of PlatformAdapter project is to have a component which allows you to probe from a platform-independent interface to its platform-specific implementation. This functionality is often needed when cross-platform compatible code is written. Imagine following scenario: You have a library which targets multiple platforms (e.g. Windows Phone, Xamarin.Android, iOS) and you want to expose one single interface IPhotoCamera. The purpose of this interface is to abstract platform-dependent code. How could you - on each platform - find the implementation for this IPhotoCamera interface? This is exactly where PlatformAdapter sneaks in!
